If you contact us as soon as you receive a notice, we can often help you explore options like loan modification, a short sale, or selling your home before the auction date. In many cases, we can begin working on your case within 24-48 hours and may be able to delay proceedings if you act quickly. Every situation is unique, but early action gives us the best chance to help."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">I never thought I’d end up needing foreclosure help, but after my hours got cut at work, things got rough fast. KK Buys Indy Homes was recommended by a neighbor, and honestly, I was nervous calling. But Karen (I think she goes by KK) was so down-to-earth and didn’t judge me at all. She explained my options clearly and actually listened to what mattered to me and my kids. The whole thing wrapped up in about two months, and I managed to avoid having a foreclosure on my record. I wish the bank had been this easy to talk to! Thanks, KK.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">KK and her team got in touch with me after I put out feelers about my house. We were a bit behind on mortgage after my wife’s surgery, so it was a stressful time. The foreclosure assistance they provided was solid—they negotiated directly with my lender and even helped me fill out the endless paperwork. It wasn’t always super fast (took about 3 months overall) and I had to chase them for updates once or twice, but overall, I felt supported. Ended up selling and walking away with a little cash, more than I expected.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Not really one to write reviews, but KK Buys Indy Homes actually helped when I was pretty much out of options. I got a foreclosure notice in September and found KK's info online. She didn’t just push me to sell right away, we talked about a few ways to keep my house first, which surprised me. In the end, selling was the best choice for me. It all took about 5 weeks, cash was in my account quick, and I wasn’t left hanging. Wish I’d known about these kinds of services earlier, honestly.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">We start with a confidential consultation to review your situation and any foreclosure notices you’ve received. Next, we analyze your options, which could include negotiating with your lender, exploring government relief programs, listing your home for a quick sale, or arranging a short sale. We handle all paperwork, communicate with your lender, and guide you step-by-step. Our goal is to relieve your stress and help you find the best solution for your needs in Plainfield.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">While we have a strong track record helping Plainfield homeowners avoid foreclosure, no company can ethically guarantee to stop every foreclosure or save every home. Success depends on factors like your mortgage status, lender cooperation, and how quickly you reach out. We promise to work tirelessly on your behalf, explain your options clearly, and do everything possible to achieve the best outcome for your situation.</div>
