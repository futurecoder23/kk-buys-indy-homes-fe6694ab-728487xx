      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We understand that selling a home during divorce can be stressful. At KK Buys Indy Homes, we start with a confidential consultation with both parties (together or separately, according to your comfort level). We’ll walk you through the sales timeline, discuss fair market value, and outline your options—whether that’s a traditional listing or a quick, cash offer. We also coordinate closely with your attorneys to make sure all legal requirements are followed, and provide regular updates so both parties are informed throughout the process."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Our standard commission for traditional listings in Zionsville is 6% of the final sale price, which covers marketing, showings, and negotiation. If you opt for a direct cash sale, there are no commissions or hidden fees—what we offer is what you take home, minus any agreed-upon closing costs. We provide a clear breakdown of all expenses upfront, so you’re never surprised by extra charges."

      "@type": "Question",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The timeline depends on the selling method you choose. For traditional listings in Zionsville, homes typically sell in 30–60 days, depending on the market and property condition. If you need a faster sale, our direct cash offer service can close in as little as 7–14 days. We’ll help you weigh your options and choose the timeline that best fits your situation."

We specialize in helping clients navigate the complexities of selling property during divorce, and have extensive experience working with local attorneys, mediators, and court-ordered sales in Zionsville and the surrounding areas."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While we can’t guarantee a specific sale price or timeline for traditional listings, we do offer a guaranteed cash offer option, so you have a backup plan if your home doesn’t sell as quickly as you’d like. If disagreements arise between parties, we act as neutral facilitators, and can recommend trusted local mediators or legal professionals to help resolve disputes. Our role is to keep the process transparent and as smooth as possible for everyone involved."

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">KK Buys Indy Homes really helped me when I needed it most. Divorce is hard enough, but selling our house in Zionsville felt like a mountain to climb. Kim was honest about pricing and what to expect, and she didn't try to sugarcoat things just to get the listing. She made sure both my ex and I were looped in on all the showings and offers, which helped us avoid a lot of arguments. The house sold after about a month, and even though we got a little less than we hoped, the process was transparent and I felt supported. Overall, I'm grateful for how smooth she made a very tough situation.</div>
                    <div class="testimonial-author">– Tina Caldwell, Zionsville</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Wasn’t sure what to expect at first, but Kim and her team at KK Buys Indy Homes handled everything with a lot of care and patience. My wife and I agreed to sell our property right after filing for divorce. I appreciated that Kim didn’t push us to rush decisions—she actually listened when we said we needed a little more time to sort logistics. The online document signing made things easier since we weren’t living together anymore. House closed in about seven weeks. I’d give five stars but there was a small mix-up with the closing date, so knocking one off. Still, would recommend for anyone in a similar spot.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">I honestly didn’t know where to start with selling my property after splitting from my husband. KK Buys Indy Homes was recommended to me by a coworker who’d been through something similar. From the first phone call, I felt less overwhelmed. Kim explained every step, from listing to showings, and was always quick to answer my (many) texts. She even suggested small things to fix up that made a difference in the sale price, without pushing me to spend a ton. The whole thing took about two months, which is what she estimated at the beginning. Wouldn’t wish divorce on anyone, but I’m glad I had someone like Kim in my corner.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">We understand that selling a home during divorce can be stressful. At KK Buys Indy Homes, we start with a confidential consultation with both parties (together or separately, according to your comfort level). We’ll walk you through the sales timeline, discuss fair market value, and outline your options—whether that’s a traditional listing or a quick, cash offer. We also coordinate closely with your attorneys to make sure all legal requirements are followed, and provide regular updates so both parties are informed throughout the process.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Our standard commission for traditional listings in Zionsville is 6% of the final sale price, which covers marketing, showings, and negotiation. If you opt for a direct cash sale, there are no commissions or hidden fees—what we offer is what you take home, minus any agreed-upon closing costs. We provide a clear breakdown of all expenses upfront, so you’re never surprised by extra charges.</div>

                        <summary>How long does it typically take to sell a home through KK Buys Indy Homes when going through a divorce?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">The timeline depends on the selling method you choose. For traditional listings in Zionsville, homes typically sell in 30–60 days, depending on the market and property condition. If you need a faster sale, our direct cash offer service can close in as little as 7–14 days. We’ll help you weigh your options and choose the timeline that best fits your situation.</div>

                        <summary>Do you offer any guarantees if my home doesn’t sell quickly or if there are disagreements during the process?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">While we can’t guarantee a specific sale price or timeline for traditional listings, we do offer a guaranteed cash offer option, so you have a backup plan if your home doesn’t sell as quickly as you’d like. If disagreements arise between parties, we act as neutral facilitators, and can recommend trusted local mediators or legal professionals to help resolve disputes. Our role is to keep the process transparent and as smooth as possible for everyone involved.</div>
